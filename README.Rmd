The goal of wafR is to provide data management and graphing according to the Margules Groome style guide. This package was originally developed for outputs from the New Zealand Wood Availability Forecasts produced by Margules Groome for the NZ Ministry for Primary Industries (MPI) but has now been extended to include other functions. The Margules Groome team may find these functions useful for more general graphing in the house style. 

More recently the package has been updated to include growth and yield functions that might be commonly used by the Margules Groome team.

The following is a list of growth and yield functions

* Volume and Taper Functions
  + Schumacher and Hall tree volume functions with coefficients from SA forestry handbook
  + Max and Burkhart taper function with coefficients from SA forestry handbook
  + Bi taper functions with published coefficients for Australian Eucalypts and P. radiata in NSW.

* Growth models

## Installation



This package is not on CRAN.You can install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("jonathandash/wafR")
```
## Example

Example of how to use the Bi taper and volume function

```{r example_vol_t}

library(wafR)

# View the stored coefficients for the Bi taper function 

bi_tapercoef_aus(species = 'PRAD')

#Example of how to estimate stem diameter for a subject tree

bi2000(DBH = 21.5, h = 20, H = 28, coefficients = bi_tapercoef_aus(species = 'PRAD'))


# Example of how to estimate stem diameter for the same subject tree

bi2000_volume(DBH = 21.5, stump_height = 0.3, h = 20, H = 28, coefficients = bi_tapercoef_aus(species = 'PRAD'))

# Example of how to estimate stem volume a subject tree using South African coefficients from the SA forestry handbook

vol_tree_safh(DBH = 21.5, H = 28, species = 'E. grandis')


# Example of how to estimate stem volume a subject tree using South African coefficients from the SA forestry handbook

tpr_max_burkhart_safh(DBH = 21.5, H = 28, h = 15, species = 'E. grandis')


```

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:


```{r example}
library(wafR)
## basic example code

data("WAF_allrep")

volume_graph_bar(data = WAF_allrep,
                 value = value, Year = Year,
                 fillvariable = Ownership,
                 WAF_form = FALSE,
                 Species_select = 'Radiata_pine')


volume_graph_bar(data = WAF_allrep,
                 value = value, Year = Year,
                 fillvariable = Ownership,
                 WAF_form = TRUE,
                 Species_select = 'Radiata_pine')


# Find outliers
x <- rnorm(n = 1000, mean = 100) # Create a normally distributed dataset

is_outlier(x) # Find outliers

boxplot(x) # Plot x to visualise the outliers



```
