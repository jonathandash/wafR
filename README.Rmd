The goal of wafR is to provide data management and graphing according to the Margules Groome style guide for outputs from the New Zealand Wood Availability Forecasts produced by Margules Groome for the NZ Ministry for Primary Industries (MPI). The Margules Groome team may also find these functions useful for more general graphing in the house style.
